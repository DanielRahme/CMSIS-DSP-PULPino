 * @brief Q31 matrix multiplication    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcA points to the first input matrix structure    
 * @param[in]       *pSrcB points to the second input matrix structure    
 * @param[out]      *pDst points to output matrix structure    
 * @return     		The function returns either    
 * <code>RISCV_MATH_SIZE_MISMATCH</code> or <code>RISCV_MATH_SUCCESS</code> based on the outcome of size checking.    
 *    
 * @details    
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>    
 *    
 * \par    
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.    
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate    
 * multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit. There is no saturation    
 * on intermediate additions. Thus, if the accumulator overflows it wraps around and    
 * distorts the result. The input signals should be scaled down to avoid intermediate    
 * overflows. The input is thus scaled down by log2(numColsA) bits    
 * to avoid overflows, as a total of numColsA additions are performed internally.    
 * The 2.62 accumulator is right shifted by 31 bits and saturated to 1.31 format to yield the final result.    
 *    
 * \par    
 * See <code>riscv_mat_mult_fast_q31()</code> for a faster but less precise implementation of this function for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4.    
 *
